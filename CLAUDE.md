# CLAUDE.md — AutoSkanerAI

AI-powered used-car listing analyzer for the Polish market. 3-week solo MVP. Spring Boot 4.0.6 (Java 21, Maven) + Angular 21.2 (TypeScript, SCSS, npm).

## Key business rules

- Absence of accident data means **unknown**, not clean. Never present missing data as confirmation of clean history — this applies to LLM prompts, API responses, and UI copy.
- The app may only report confirmed accident data from the listing text or a vehicle history report.

## API error shape

All Spring controllers must return errors in this exact shape — no exceptions, no `ProblemDetail`:

```json
{ "status": 400, "error": "Błąd walidacji", "messages": ["field: message"], "timestamp": "2026-05-24T12:00:00Z" }
```

- `ErrorResponse` record lives in `com.example.autoskaner_ai.common`
- `GlobalExceptionHandler` (`@RestControllerAdvice`) in the same package handles: `MethodArgumentNotValidException` (400), `HttpMessageNotReadableException` (400), catch-all `Exception` (500)
- `messages` is `List<String>`; for validation errors format each entry as `"field: message"`
- `timestamp` is `Instant.now()`

## AI service pattern

The AI layer uses a Spring interface with two Profile-switched implementations:

- `AiAnalysisService` — interface defining the contract
- `MockAiAnalysisService` — deterministic mocks, activate with `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=mock`
- `LlmAnalysisService` — real LLM calls (Claude API or OpenAI), activate with `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=llm`

Required env vars when running `llm` profile: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

## Monorepo structure

```
backend/    Spring Boot 4.0.6, Java 21, Maven
frontend/   Angular 21.2, TypeScript, SCSS, npm
context/    10xDevs chain artifacts (PRD, tech-stack, shape-notes) — do not edit
```

## Build and run

```bash
# Backend
cd backend && ./mvnw spring-boot:run     # dev server on :8080
cd backend && ./mvnw test                # unit tests

# Frontend
cd frontend && npm start                 # dev server on :4200
cd frontend && npm run build             # production build → dist/
```

## Architecture decisions

- Frontend and backend are separate apps communicating via REST. Configure CORS on the Spring side or proxy `/api` in `angular.json` for dev.
- No database yet — add PostgreSQL (prod) + H2 (dev) when implementing FR-010 (persistence).
- Auth not yet implemented — Spring Security + JWT or OAuth2 planned per PRD.
- CEPiK integration (live vehicle registry queries) is post-MVP, FR-017.

## Current state

Bare scaffold — no feature code written yet. PRD is at `context/foundation/prd.md` (FR-001 to FR-017). Start feature work from FR-001.

## Deployment

- Backend: Render Web Service (Docker, service `autoskaner-ai-backend`, URL `https://autoskanerai.onrender.com`) — live
- Frontend: Cloudflare Pages (`autoskaner-ai`, URL `https://autoskaner-ai.pages.dev`) — live; auto-deploys on push to `main`
- CI/CD: auto-deploy wired on both platforms (push to `main` triggers deploy)
- GitHub: https://github.com/PrzemyslawPrzeworski/AutoSkanerAI

## 10xDevs AI Toolkit - Module 2, Lesson 5

Scale the single-change cycle into parallel work with **worktrees, goal-directed delegation, and multi-session orchestration**:

```
worktree per change -> /goal or claude -p -> PR -> review -> merge
```

The lesson focus is safe throughput: isolated contexts, choosing the right execution mode, and capping parallelism at review capacity.

### Task Router - Where to start

| Skill | Use it when |
| --- | --- |
| **Code isolation** | |
| `git worktree add` | You need a separate working directory for a parallel change. One change per worktree, one fresh agent context per worktree. |
| **Complex changes** | |
| `/10x-implement <change-id> phase <n>` | The change has multiple phases, needs manual gates, or benefits from interactive decision-making during execution. |
| **Simple changes** | |
| `/goal` | You have a clear, bounded task and want goal-directed delegation. The agent works autonomously toward the stated goal with a stop condition. |
| `claude -p` | You want headless execution for a well-defined task. The Ralph Wiggum loop (run, check, retry) is the universal autonomous pattern. |
| **Multi-session orchestration** | |
| Superset / Conductor / Antigravity / VS Code Agent View | You are running multiple agent sessions in parallel and need visibility, coordination, or session management across them. |

### Parallel work rules

- One change per worktree or isolated workspace. One fresh agent context per change.
- Choose interactive `/10x-implement` for complex changes, `/goal` or `claude -p` for simple ones.
- Parallelism is capped by review capacity. More agents without review means more unreviewed code, not higher throughput.
- The quality pain from faster shipping is intentional — it bridges into Module 3 testing gates.

### Lesson boundaries

- Do not reteach interactive `/10x-implement` or `/10x-impl-review`; those are Lessons 2 and 3.
- Do not introduce testing strategy here. The quality pain is the motivation for Module 3.
- Worktrees are a mechanism for isolation, not the topic of a full git tutorial.

### Paths used by this lesson

- `context/changes/<change-id>/` - active change folder
- `context/changes/<change-id>/plan.md` - implementation input for any execution mode

Skills must not write to `context/archive/`. Archived changes are immutable; if a resolved target path starts with `context/archive/`, abort with: "This change is archived. Open a new change with `/10x-new` instead."
